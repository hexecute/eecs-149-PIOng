EECS 149/249A Project Charter, Fall, 2015 


Project Goal
This project will model the Ping Pong related Motion obtained from embedded sensors inside a Ping Pong racket.
Project Approach
The movements relevant to the Game will be modelled as a State Machine and will be determined based on the input from sensors and the timestamps associated with them. Detection would include detecting a Serve, Forehand, Backhand, all the while tracking speeds and Angle as well.

* December 2: Actuation in response to door sensor, timing of network measured.
* December 9: System testing, measure false positives, assess timing effectiveness.
* December 16: Demonstration video made, powerpoint prepared.
* December 17: Final presentation and demo.
* December 19: Project report and video turned in.
Risk and Feasibility
Timing is a major concern for us, we may consider time-stamping each data input to build reliable analysis. The communication may have issues that lead to unforeseen input delays. Software analysis may not accurately predict motions.
