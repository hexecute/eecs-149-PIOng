First *recorded* meeting minutes

Tuesday slides:
    Goals slide:
        Minimum Viable Product
        Stretch goals
    Status slide:
        Current status
            Mainly planning
            Kevin's gyroscope board mockup
        Problems
            Example: Omar's Wii-mote machine learning
    Each person presents what they add to the slides

Minimum Viable Product:
    Ping pong paddle that can detect a swing
        Data saved to a file over Bluetooth low energy and processed later

Stretch goals:
    Force sensor
    Location of ball sensor (may be possible to integrate with force sensor)
    Real-time processing with a web interface

Hardware:
    9-axis accelerometer with board {I don't remember the name of the board.}
    Order for the board has been placed 
    Potential issues:
        Number of pins for additional sensors
        Attaching sensor pins to board securely

Software:
    Python, SVM for machine learning
    Probably not using temporal logic

Hardware: Kevin, Will
Software: Omar, Peter
Divisions are primary focus, not solid boundaries.
